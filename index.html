        <p class="aboutme">I come from a long line of statisticians and engineers, 
but for some reason my parents took a
            180 and became theatre people - so I rebelled and chose archaeology.

            <br><br>Yep, that's me. I bet you're wondering how I ended up here at 
GreenFox. I will explain at some point but first
            look at these important definitions below.

            <dt>Logic gate</dt>
            <dd>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean 
function; that is, it performs a logical
                operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single 
binary output.</dd>

            <dt>ASCII</dt>
            <dd>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. 
Computers can only understand numbers,
                so it is the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' 
or '@' or an action of some sort.</dd>

            <dt>Random-access memory (RAM)</dt>
            <dd>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used 
program instructions to increase the
                general speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items 
to be read or written in almost the
                same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data 
inside the memory.</dd>

            <dt>Programming language</dt>
            <dd>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be 
used to produce various kinds of
                output. They generally consist of instructions for a computer and 
can be used to create programs that
                implement specific algorithms.</dd>

            <dt>Domain Name System (DNS)</dt>
            <dd>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, 
services, or other resources connected to the
